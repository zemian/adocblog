ADocBlog - A simple content management system.

The AdocBlog is a Java based web application that provides
CMS features. You may use it to write and manage blog and
site content in HTML or Asciidoc format. 

== Getting the Binary Package

We currently do not provide binary package for download. You would have to get
the source code and build it yourself. If you have typical Java tools already
setup, then it should be as simple as following:

  mvn package -P with-version-file

You probably want to checkout the released tag instead of latest master
branch for stable build. If you're interested in more on how to be a developer, 
see the link:developer.adoc[Developer Guide].

After the build, you should get the binary package as `target/adocblog.war` file.

== Setting up DB

The ADocBlog requires a DB storage. The default configuration is setup to use
PostgreSQL 9 or higher. Assume you have the DB server installed in your
machine and their tools available in your terminal, then you can setup a new 
DB like this:

----
createuser adocblog
createdb --owner=adocblog adocblog_dev
psql -U adocblog adocblog_dev < db/create-schema.sql
----

After you setup a new DB, you need at least one application user for the
ADocBlog. You can create an `admin` user using our tool script.

  bin/user-tool.sh --create --adminUser=true --fullName="ADocBlog Admin" admin mySecretPassword


== How to Run/Deploy ADocBlog

The `adocblog.war` is self-contained and it can be deployed into any Java based 
Servlet container server, and it should run without problems. You need to
find instructions on how to deploy `war` application in your server env.

Here we will show you how to run Tomcat server with a special and easy
command line tool called `webapp-runner`.

=== Using `webapp-runner` Tomcat Server

If you have build ADocBlog binrary package with above instruction, then you 
already have `webapp-runner` tool. Try running:

  java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar target/adocblog.war --port 8080

Now you can open `http://localhost:8080/admin` to start publishing content!


== Setup New ADocBlog Config

The ADocBlog is designed to be able to load different configurable environment.
The configuration files set can be stored in a directory under the Java classpath
under `adocblog`. Without explicit set an env, it default to `dev` settings.

To create a new set of configration files, create a directory like this:

----
mkdir -p config/adocblog/myenv
touch config/adocblog/myenv/app.properties

# Edit app.properties with the following:
app.env = myenv
app.ds.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/adocblog_myenv
app.ds.username = adocblog
app.ds.password =
----

Now you need to startup ADocBlog with this `config` folder added in classpath:

  java -Dadocblog.env=myenv \
  -cp "config:target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar" \
  webapp.runner.launch.Main target/adocblog.war \
  --port 8080

Note that we can't no longer use the `-jar` Java option as before, but to use
full classpath and explicit Java main class to load the war file. Also note
that Java `-cp` option contains path separator that's OS specific. If you
are on Windows, you would need to use `;` instead.

You may also override any config files besides `app.properties` file. For
example you may override `logback.xml` or `freemarker.properties` settings
to suite your need in your environment. Consult the developer guide to see
all possible files you may use.
